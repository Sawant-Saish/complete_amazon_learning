## Amazon Clone Project
#### made via hands-on while learning js from *SuperSimpleDev*.

This repo/Project is made while learning javaScript by following the video lecture of **SuperSimpleDev**.
- By this i understood the workflow of the complete javaScript and some part of backend, further i will make some of the changes in this.
- I have made the main page, checkout page, and order page interactive using javascript.
  - The order page contains a bit of my backed learnings.
 
### That was about it.... I'll be learning react and express after this and simultaneously make some projects.
